\caption{ A sample of 10 random instances in the Titanic dataset, which contains various data about passengers on the  Titanic before it sank, including whether they survived or not. This dataset is often used in examples of  supervised machine learning on tabular data, where one would usually attempt to predict the last column (``Survived'') based on features such as sex and age.  }
